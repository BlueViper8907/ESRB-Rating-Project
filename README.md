# Overview:
Predict a Video Games ESRB rating & find a model that provides the highest level of confidence in classifiying and distinguishing E rating from M rating.

# The Data
Accompanying CSV's provided by Kaggle
- The data was packaged into separate train and test sets. Ratings ranged from E for Everyone, E10+/ET for Everyone 10 and up, T for Teen and M for Mature. Several factors, variables and scales of the factors weigh on a games ability to be scored and rated. With categories like Blood having several variations as Blood, Blood and Gore, Mild Blood and Animated Blood.

# The Process
I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to perform <a href=https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-and-regression-trees-for-machine-learning/> Decision Tree </a> , <a href=https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-nearest-neighbors-for-machine-learning/> KNN </a> & <a href=https://machinelearningmastery.com/bagging-and-random-forest-ensemble-algorithms-for-machine-learning/> Random Forest </a> models to predict a video games rating and it's ability to distinguish between ratings.

# O - Obtain
I obtained the ESRB Rating dataset from Kaggle. If you want to get started on your own, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/imohtn/video-games-rating-by-esrb"> for this repo.</a><br>

# S - Scrub
After importing all the data I checked it for null values, duplicates and any datatype errors that may present a problem in Exploratory Data Analysis or Machine Learning Modeling

# E - Explore

# M - Model

# N - iNterpret

# Observations

# Future Work
